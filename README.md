# ForceHub


A Telegram bot, to force a user to follow your [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jainamoswal) account before chatting.

This bot will mute the user if not followed. It works with [Telegram](https:///www.telegram.org) [Auth](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login) and [GitHub](https:///www.github.com) [oAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps).

---
## Steps :~ 

- Add following variables to the envirenment variables.

    - [x] `API_HASH` ~ Get it from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth)

    - [x] `APP_ID` ~ Get it from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth)

    - [x] `APP_DOMAIN` ~ Your application domain name. eg. https://jainam.me. 

    - [x] `BOT_TOKEN` ~ Get it from [@BotFather.](https://t.me/botfather)

    - [x] `GITHUB_USERNAME` ~ Your [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jainamoswal) username, which you want users to force-follow.

    - [x] `MONGO_URL` ~ [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com) URL, to save user's github usernames after login via GitHub oAuth2.

    - [x] `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` ~ Make it random value, It will be used to access session cookie while [Telegram](https://t.me/j_projects) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jainamoswal) linking. 

    - [x] `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` ~ Your GitHub oAuth credential. Get it from [here.](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)

        > Assuming `github-app.herokuapp.com` as my App's endpoint.

        > Add App URL in GitHub app settings. eg. `https://github-app.herokuapp.com/`

        > Add App URL and a callback route to it. eg. `https://github-app.herokuapp.com/login/github/authorize`


    - [x] `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` ~ Your GitHub oAuth credential. Get it from [here.](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)

    - [x] `PORT` ~ Leave it blank, as Heroku will assign it.
